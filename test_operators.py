# Test file for Python operators
a = 5
b = 10

# Comparison operators
result = a == b  # equality
result = a != b  # inequality
result = a < b  # less than
result = a > b  # greater than
result = a <= b  # less than or equal
result = a >= b  # greater than or equal

# Logical operators
result = True and False
result = True or False
result = not True

# Identity and membership
result = a is b
result = a in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Arithmetic operators
result = a + b  # addition
result = a - b  # subtraction
result = a * b  # multiplication
result = a / b  # division
result = a // b  # floor division
result = a % b  # modulo
result = a**b  # exponentiation

# Assignment operators
a += 5
a -= 2
a *= 3
a /= 2
a //= 2
a %= 3
a **= 2

# Bitwise operators (need integers)
c = 5
d = 10
result = c & d  # bitwise AND
result = c | d  # bitwise OR
result = c ^ d  # bitwise XOR
result = ~c  # bitwise NOT
result = c << 2  # left shift
result = c >> 2  # right shift
